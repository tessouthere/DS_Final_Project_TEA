# DS_Final_Project_TEA

This project delved into the realm of predictive analytics to enhance the operational efficiency and welfare outcomes of a no-kill animal shelter. Leveraging a dataset encompassing over 28,000 records of cats from the Austin Animal Shelter, this study employed a Random Forest model to predict the outcomes of sheltered cats with a commendable accuracy of nearly 73%. By scrutinizing various features such as age, breed, sex, and spay/neuter status, the model aided in foreseeing potential outcomes including adoption and transfer. The insights gleaned from this predictive model empower shelter administrators to allocate resources judiciously, optimize strategic decision-making processes, and ultimately bolster the prospects of finding permanent homes for cats, thereby fostering a more humane and sustainable approach to animal welfare.

# EDA: 
Report, Tableau Workbook, and Jupyter Notebook are added which encapsulate the EDA process for this analysis. 

# Preliminary Predictive Analytics Model:
Jupyter Notebook is added which contains the process and results of the preliminary Random Forest model used for this analysis.

# Poster:
Poster added.
pptx added: Recommended changes applied. Updated poster is added in powerpoint format.

# Final Model Files:
Final model is same model as preliminary (RF).
Other notebooks are included which contain my examination of other models, however none of them outperformed the original RF.
